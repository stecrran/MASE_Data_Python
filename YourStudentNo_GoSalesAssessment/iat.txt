In pandas, the .iat[] accessor is used to access a single value for a row/column label pair by integer position. It is particularly efficient for accessing scalar
values (i.e., individual elements) within a DataFrame.

Breakdown of iat[]
Purpose: The .iat[] accessor is designed to retrieve a single value from a DataFrame or Series using the integer index positions. This is faster than using .loc[] or .iloc[]
when you know the exact location of the value you want.
Syntax:
The syntax for using .iat[] is dataframe.iat[row_index, column_index], where row_index is the integer index of the row and column_index is the integer index of the column.
However, when you already have a Series (like result['Unit price'] in your example), you can also use .iat[] to get a specific value from that Series by specifying
just the row index.
Example
Given your example unitPrice = result['Unit price'].iat[0], here’s what it does:

result['Unit price']: This part retrieves the 'Unit price' column from the DataFrame result, returning a Series.
.iat[0]: This accesses the first element (0-based index) of that Series. In other words, it retrieves the unit price of the first row in the 'Unit price' column.
When to Use .iat[]
Use .iat[] when you need to access a single value and know its position, as it is optimized for this purpose.
It’s particularly useful when you want to avoid the overhead associated with more complex indexing methods like .loc[] or .iloc[].
Example of .iat[]
Here’s a complete example to illustrate how .iat[] works:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Product number': [101, 102, 103],
    'Unit price': [19.99, 29.99, 39.99]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Assuming you want to get the unit price of the first product
unitPrice = df['Unit price'].iat[0]

print("Unit Price of the first product:", unitPrice)
Output
plaintext
Copy code
Unit Price of the first product: 19.99
Summary
.iat[] is a fast and efficient way to access a single value in a DataFrame or Series by its integer index.
In your example, unitPrice = result['Unit price'].iat[0] retrieves the first unit price from the 'Unit price' column of the result DataFrame,
giving you a specific scalar value directly.
