The pd.qcut() function in pandas is used to perform quantile-based binning, which means it divides the data into bins such that each bin has (approximately)
the same number of data points. Unlike pd.cut(), which creates bins with equal width, pd.qcut() creates equal-frequency bins based on quantiles.
This can be helpful for binning data that is skewed, as it ensures each bin has a similar number of values, making it easier to analyze and compare groups.

How pd.qcut() Works
Quantiles: Quantiles divide the data into equal-sized portions, such as quartiles (4 equal parts), deciles (10 equal parts), etc.
Equal-frequency bins: pd.qcut() creates bins where each bin has the same number of data points, based on the quantiles of the data distribution.
Syntax of pd.qcut()
python
Copy code
pd.qcut(data, q, labels=None)
data: The data series or column to bin.
q: The number of quantiles to use, or a list of quantile values. For example:
If q=4, it will divide the data into 4 equal-frequency bins (quartiles).
If q=10, it will divide the data into 10 equal-frequency bins (deciles).
labels: Optional labels to assign to each bin. If not provided, the bins will be represented by intervals.
Example of Using pd.qcut()
Consider a dataset with student scores, and we want to divide the students into 4 quartiles based on their scores.


# Sample data
data = {'scores': [35, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Apply qcut with 4 quantiles (quartiles)
df['score_quartile'] = pd.qcut(df['scores'], q=4, labels=['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4'])

print(df)
Output

5       65            Q2
6       70            Q3
7       75            Q3
8       80            Q3
9       85            Q3
10      90            Q4
11      95            Q4
12     100            Q4

Explanation of the Example
4 Quantiles: The q=4 argument divides the data into 4 equal-frequency groups, or quartiles.
The first quartile (Q1) includes the lowest 25% of scores.
The second quartile (Q2) includes the next 25%, and so on.
Labels: The labels ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4'] were assigned to the quartiles, making it easy to see which quartile each score belongs to.
Equal Frequency: Each quartile contains (approximately) the same number of data points, even if the scores in each quartile are not evenly spaced.
Key Differences Between pd.cut() and pd.qcut()
Function	Description	Use Case
pd.cut()	Divides data into equal-width bins.	Suitable for uniformly distributed data.
pd.qcut()	Divides data into equal-frequency bins based on quantiles.	Suitable for skewed or non-uniform data.
Practical Use Cases of pd.qcut()
Creating Percentile Ranks: pd.qcut() is useful for dividing data into percentiles, quartiles, deciles, etc., to analyze the distribution of values.
Handling Skewed Data: By using quantiles, pd.qcut() can manage skewed data more effectively than pd.cut().
Comparison of Groups: Equal-frequency bins make it easier to compare groups, as each bin contains a similar number of data points.
Summary
pd.qcut() is a pandas function that divides data into equal-frequency bins based on quantiles. It’s ideal for grouping data with non-uniform distributions,
and it allows you to create bins where each bin has an equal number of data points, which can be more meaningful for analysis and visualization.

Steps to Assign Values to Quartiles
Sorting the Data:

First, pd.qcut() sorts the data from lowest to highest.

Dividing into Quantiles:

Since we requested 4 quantiles (quartiles) with q=4, pandas divides the sorted data into 4 groups with (roughly) the same number of values in each.
With 13 data points, dividing them as evenly as possible would result in about 3-4 values per quartile.
Determining the Cut Points (Bin Edges):

Pandas then finds the cut points, or bin edges, so that each quartile contains about the same number of values.
For example, with pd.qcut() for 4 quantiles, the bin edges are calculated so that:
Q1 includes roughly the lowest 25% of the values.
Q2 includes roughly the next 25%.
Q3 includes the next 25%.
Q4 includes the top 25%.
For this data, pd.qcut() would determine edges approximately at:
Q1: Values from 35 up to around 50.
Q2: Values from 50 up to around 65.
Q3: Values from 65 up to around 85.
Q4: Values from 85 to 100.
Assigning Values to Quartiles:

Each data point is then assigned to its respective bin (quartile) based on these edges:
Q1: [35, 45, 50]
Q2: [50, 55, 60, 65]
Q3: [70, 75, 80, 85]
Q4: [90, 95, 100]
In this process, the value 50 appears in both Q1 and Q2 because pd.qcut() handles the assignment so that each bin contains approximately equal numbers of values.

Why Some Bins Have More Values
When the data size isn’t perfectly divisible by the number of bins, pd.qcut() tries to balance the bins as closely as possible. In this example:

Q1 has 3 values.
Q2, Q3, and Q4 have 4 values each.
This balance is based on the best approximation to ensure an equal distribution of data points across the specified quantiles.
