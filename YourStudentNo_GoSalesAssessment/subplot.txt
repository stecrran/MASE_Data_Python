The line of code fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8)) is commonly used in matplotlib, a popular plotting library in Python. This line creates a figure and
a set of subplots, setting up the basic structure for a plot. Let’s break down what each part does:

Code Breakdown
plt.subplots(): This function creates a new figure and one or more subplots within that figure.

By default, it creates a single subplot (a 1x1 grid) unless specified otherwise.
The function returns two objects:
fig: The figure object, which is the overall container for the plot. You can think of it as the canvas where one or more subplots (axes) are drawn.
ax: The axes object (or a list of axes objects if there are multiple subplots), which represents the actual plot area where data is plotted.
Each ax object has methods for plotting, setting labels, titles, etc.
figsize=(12, 8): This argument specifies the size of the figure in inches.

12 refers to the width, and 8 refers to the height, so this line creates a figure that is 12 inches wide and 8 inches tall.
Adjusting the figsize helps control the aspect ratio and overall appearance of the plot.
Example
Here’s how you might use this to create a simple plot:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a figure and an axis with a specified size
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))

# Plot some example data
ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 25, 30])

# Add labels and title
ax.set_title('Example Plot')
ax.set_xlabel('X-axis')
ax.set_ylabel('Y-axis')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
Explanation
This code creates a plot that’s 12x8 inches, giving a wider space for plotting data.
The ax object is used to plot the data, set titles, and add labels to the axes.
Why Use figsize
Changing figsize is helpful for:

Improving readability of the plot, especially for presentations or reports where larger plots may be easier to read.
Adjusting for complex plots with multiple subplots or detailed data, where a larger figure can prevent crowding.
Customizing layouts for different display mediums, like notebooks or printed reports.
Summary
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8)) initializes a figure with dimensions of 12 inches by 8 inches, providing a canvas (fig) and a
plot area (ax) to customize and display data.
