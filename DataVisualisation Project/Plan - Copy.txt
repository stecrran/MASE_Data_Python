 - Pull directly from database into Python instead of using CSV files
 - Include functions to merge all required data using Pandas
 - Create table with all required information
 - Visualise gross revenue (USD) based on genre
 - Look at Profit/Loss, % or Ratio
 - Group genre by year, visualise
 - Determine what additional information could be presented e.g. GR: Other countries
 - Look at actors v. revenue

create resultset - write query for actors etc... add dropdown to allow user pick field. When user picks actor -> list of movies appears which star that actor. 
"search actor bt name" - use %like% where genre, use user input letter to match e.g. search 'ste' to return stephen, stefano, stewart.... Use code and GUI that Karol provided on Moodle.

Use the Pearson tool for predictive analysis. Independent = Budget, Dependent = Gross Revenue.
You could do predictive analysis for multiple actors, and rank them.
Try creating a heatmap using multiple variables if you are trying to find a correlation.


merge 

csv files modified:
- corrected characters
- removed any films with non-USD currency
- is it possible to adjust values for inflation?


Get data from database, merge based on data taken from database. The current data was exported using a mySQL query. Try to get all data merged with one Python function and then generate graphs and tables based on that.
